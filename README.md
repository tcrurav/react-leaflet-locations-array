## Some tips to start using react-leaflet

As you can see in this example you need the following packages:
```
npm install leaflet
npm install react-leaflet
```

It's important that you import the leaflet styles when you are using react-leaflet:
```
import "leaflet/dist/leaflet.css";
```

When you are using react-leaflet don't forget to give some dimmensions to your map. If you don't then the map is going to be invisible. Here are the style class I have used for the `MapContainer` in this example:
```
.locations-map-container{
  margin: 10vh auto;
  width: 80vw;
  height: 80vh;
}
```
